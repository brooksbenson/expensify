# React

React is a JavaScript library for composing user interfaces. It is component-based, meaning each piece of UI is an encapsulated unit that manages its own state. As the state of the application changes, React will efficiently update and render the right components.

## JSX

JSX is an extension to JavaScript and is capable of describing what the UI looks like. It is like a templating language, but because it is an extension to JS it is capable of being much more dynamic. After JSX is compiled, its expressions are fed to functions that return objects. These objects are what React uses to construct the DOM.
